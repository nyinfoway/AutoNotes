AutoNotes
=========

Auto Notes extension on Google Chrome Webstore, to take notes from any web page opened in Chrome browser.

## The problem.
In this age of Internet, abundance of information can be a problem. We browse hundreds of web pages everyday, and it would be better if we could organize and capture that information for future use. Note taking helps to solve this problem.

Most of the popular tools such as [Evernote](), [Microsoft OneNote]() or [Catch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threebanana.notes), all off them are good, but they require users to copy the contents and paste them into the application for future keep. Switching from one application to other distract us from the content we're going through and could be disruptive.

With Auto Notes, you can capture notes without leaving the web page you're browsing. Auto Notes works for Google Chrome for now.

## What does it do?
Auto Notes allows you to capture notes from any web page you're browsing in Chrome with a single short cut command. Simple select the contents on the web page and press 'ALT+A' on your keyboard or Select 'Send to Auto Notes' option from right click menu. All notes you take is quietly captured in your local database, which can be saved as a Google document anytime you wish.

Viewing your notes is also simple, press 'ALT+S' from any page or through link on extension pop up page in Chrome.
